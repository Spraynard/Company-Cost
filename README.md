# Company Cost :money_with_wings: :page_with_curl:
An app that allows users to track the operating cost of business operations. Also can provide an even more insightful look into your personal life by giving a basic view of your budget.

## App Documentation / How-To
This section will explain the philosophy of what the app provides, and how to use the app.

### Philosophy
This app was made in order to provide users with a detailed look of their operating costs, whether in a business or a personal sense. The user is given the ability to be as detailed as they want to be with categorization of their expenses. Listed below are the tools given to users to have this amount of customization.

* `Expense Groups`
Thought of as a category of expenses. Each of these groups contain `Expenses` that build towards the working total of that category (as well as the working total of the whole worksheet)

* `Expenses` - also known as `Expense Group Children`
Pretty self explanatory. Each of these is one expense filled with monetary information related to how much money is required for that "operation" in your operating cost.
